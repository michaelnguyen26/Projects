- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I am a Master of Software Engineering graduate student at UC Irvine (Class of 2022). My projects were developed independently (self-taught), I hope you see this is a reflection of my abilities. I will be expanding my projects further once I gather more information during my studies, so stay tuned!
 
- ðŸ¤– My interest is to become a software engineer and develop applications that have a meaningful impact in the community. I am particularly interested within the field of robotics including neural networks, machine learning, and AI.

- ðŸ’» I am using Python and Java as my main programming languages.

-  Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!
